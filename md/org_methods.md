# Organizing methods talks  

For short talks about methods, I like the following outline:  
- Title slide.  
- One motivating example.  
- A one-slide overview of your method's advantages.  
- Several slides covering the key high-level details about your method.  
- A slide or two providing evidence that your method works well.  
- The end.  

### The title slide

All this needs is the title of the talk, your name and affiliation, the names (and affiliations, if there's room) of your collaborators/funders.  Don't be a dick by failing to acknowledge your collaborators.  

### One motivating example  

I am a strong advocate of beginning every methods talk with a single clear, compelling example.  In a short talk especially, I think this should start from slide 2, immediately after the title slide.  No need for an outline.  

Here's why.  You should assume that your audience has a default skepticism of the need for a new method in the first place.  ("Stop telling me my old things don't work, and get offa' my lawn!")  Even if they don't hold this view, assuming that they do is a powerful rhetorical strategy anyway.  Therefore your primary duty is to _melt away their skepticism._  You might as well do it from the very beginning.  There is no clearer way than an awesome motivating example to establish _why_ there is a need for your method in the first place.

The perfect motivating example has the following properties:  
- you can explain the example in a picture or two, with very little text  
- there is some clear off-the-shelf procedure that everybody would reach for in order to approach this problem  
- But there are some issues with this off-the-shelf procedure that you can articulate, or even better, see in a picture.  
- Your method, on the hand, addresses these issues, or most of them, without trouble.  

Likewise, the arcetypal "motivating example" section has three sub-parts:  
1) the problem/data set.  Ideally you can summarize this in one slide with a picture, complemented by your own verbal description.  , maybe two.  

### Overview of your method's advantages.

Try to keep this to one slide.


### Some slides about the details  

In progress.  


### Evidence that your method works well

In progress.  

### The end

Your last slide should have a reference (or maybe even a scannable QR code) to your paper and/or software package.  If you have room, include the names of your collaborators/funders again on the final slide.
