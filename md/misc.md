# Miscellaneous advice on talks  


### Formatting your slides  

- Use a sans serif font -- archetypally Helvetica, but sans serif is key.  

- Use dark text on a light background.  

- Don't show computer output.  Format the table prettily.  

- Absolutely include references, in Author (Year) format, to a few key papers where appropriate.  Especially do this if Author is in the audience!  But there is no need for extensive bibliography or lots of references.  That is what the paper is for.  Don't feel bad about saying, "There are a lot of key references that I haven't covered here, including work by X and Y, and we have a comprehensive bibiography in the paper."  Remember Commandment 10.  

- Don't use your institution's logo on every slide.  Especially if your institution is famous and/or very high up in the U.S. News and World Report rankings for American undergraduate colleges, you will look like a tool.   

- Some of your viewers will inevitably be colorblind.  Use a color scale they can read.  

- Slow reveals are (usually) gimmicky.  Do not reveal bullet points one at time, except for a very good reason.  \pause is the lamest Beamer command.  One reasonable exception might be a "slow reveal" on a one-slide summary of key findings (your headlines).  

- Do not waste time on an outline slide in a short talk.  Get straight to the problem + headlines results (findings talk) or motivating example (methods talk).  These are outline enough -- functionally, if not literally, since they carve out the intellectual ground you will cover.   


### Stage presence

- Breathe and stand tall.  Smile.  

- Aim for a speaking rate of about 150 words per minute.  It's perfectly OK to go a bit faster or slower if doing so feels natural to you.  But 150 wpm is typical for a radio host, and 145-160 wpm is the guideline that publishers give to voice actors for audiobooks.  It's a good baseline.  

- If you're using an old-school microphone, i.e. the kind you hold in your hand, do not speak directly into it.  Your plosives (especially your P's) will annoy and perhaps deafen the audience.  Instead, hold it a few inches below your mouth, and speak out to the audience, not down to the mic.  The mic will pick you up just fine.  

- Use your laser pointer sparingly.  It can be super useful, but also super distrating if you wield that thing like light saber in a Jedi fight.  In your practice talk, have a kind audience member/guinea pig monitor your laser pointer usage.  If they say it got distracting, then make a habit of keeping your laser point on a table/lectern/etc.  WHen you need it, pick it up, make three small circles around the thing you want to call attention to, then put the pointer down again.

- Stick to the time limit.  It is simply a question of good manners.  You are probably not the only one speaking in your session.  And even if you are, then you are the only thing between the audience and their coffee, lunch, bathroom break, dopamine hit from their phones, etc.
