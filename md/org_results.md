# Organizing "results" talks 

For talks about empirical findings, I like the following outline:  
- Title slide.  
- A one-slide overview of the current scientific understanding of your problem.  
- A one-slide overview of your findings.  
- Finding 1
- ...
- Finding N.
- The end.  

## Title slide

  

## The overview of current understanding  

What do people think now about the problem you're studying?  This should be super short.  It's purpose is to tee up the discussion of your findings.  

## The overview of your findings: story - lede - headline

Suppose you've decided up front what are the main things -- probably somewhere between one and three -- that you want to communicate in your talk.  For the sake of example, let's say it's three things.  These are the _stories_ you want to tell.

Now do the following:

1) Summarize each of your three stories in a single, substantive, concise but self-contained paragraph.  Journalists would call such a paragraph a _lede_ for each story.  Edit these paragraphs like a journalist would.  Make them tight, sharp, specific, and memorable.  

2) Memorize each of these three paragraphs.  Each paragraph should have a clear beginning, middle, and end.  Practice speaking each one aloud several times.  Each one should take somewhere between 30 seconds and a minute to read aloud.  That's somewhere between 75 and 150 words (see below).  

3) Now summarize each of those paragraphs in a single SHORT sentence or phrase.  Be pithy if appropriate.  This is the _headline_ for that story.  

4) Make a single slide for the headlines.  Make each headline a bullet point.  This is the single most important slide of your talk.  I'll call this the "Headlines" slide, but in your actual presentation, you should call it "Findings", "New Results," "Key Ideas," "Take-away Messages," or whatever seems appropriate for the audience and the content.  

5) Take the headlines one by one.  For each one, recite your memorized "lede" paragraph, prefaced by a "First," "Second," "Third" and maybe a short pause.

Presto!  You've just given the first 2-3 minutes of your talk (maybe less if you have just one main idea to convey).  You have piqued people's interest and given them a crystal clear idea for where you are going next.  Plus, anyone who stops listening now will still remember the key ideas.
