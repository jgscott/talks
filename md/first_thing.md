# Your first decision before you start working on your talk    

For the kind of talks that a data scientist tends to give, there is one very important decision to make up front.  Ask yourself:  
- Is my talk fundamentally about a method -- a new model, new algorithm, new data pipeline, etc?  
- Or is my talk fundamentally about a new set of empirical findings?  

Some talks might be a little bit of both, but for now, pick the dominant theme and go with it.  I'd say at least 95% of data-science talks, probably more, are pretty clearly one or the other.

The expectations of methods talks and findings talks are different enough that we have to consider them separately.  In a short talk, it's all a question of opportunity cost.  If your talk is about a method, you will skimp on detail about the empirical findings, except insofar as those findings illustrate paradigmatic advantages of your method.  There just isn't time.  

Similarly, if your talk is fundamentally about scientific findings, you will skimp on methodological details.  The question(s) and answer(s) are FAR more important.  Again, there just isn't time.  Methodological details are what the _paper_ is for.
