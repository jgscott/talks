# My top ten tips for giving good scientific talks  

### 1) Know your shit.

It's OK to admit ignorance.  But if it becomes clear at some point during the talk that you are making claims about something you don't understand, you will lose the trust of everybody in the room who does, indeed, know your shit.  At that point you are basically toast.  

### 2) Know your audience.

Don't underestimate their intelligence, but don't overestimate their knowledge.  

### 3) Tell a story.

[Be organized](https://github.com/jgscott/talks/blob/master/md/org_methods.md), but also be entertaining, in a highbrow, long-piece-in-the-New-Yorker kinda way.  Yes, this is a scientific talk, and you are absolutely not there to put on a clown costume and juggle machetes that have been doused in kerosene and set ablaze.  But you _must_ entertain people and hold their interest.  There must be a narrative arc to your talk, just like in a documentary film or a long-form piece of quality journalism.

I swear to you, people will straight up go to sleep in their chairs if you don't actively keep them awake.  And when they snore, it will actually embarrass them more than it does you, but it sure as hell won't feel that way to you at the time.  

### 4) Keep things simple.

The number one problem I see with most talks is that they try to cram in too much detail.  I'm sorry to have to inform you that most people in the room will simply not care about most of the details.  To avoid getting bogged down, force yourself to focus as much as possible on the _question_ and the _answer_, plus maybe one or two important, novel, interesting details.  The question creates suspense; the answer resolves it.  This is good storytelling.  

Here's a simple guideline: if you're in doubt about whether to include a whole slide about some specific detail in your talk, don't include it.  Instead, put it as "backup" slide at the end, for Q&A.  (You might easily have more backup slides than real slides.  Hey, you never know what questions people will ask!)  Then practice your talk in front of your advisor.  (See below.)  If they object that the missingness of some necessary detail is a talk-killer, you can promote that detail from a backup slide to real slide.

(And if your advisor will not listen to you practice your short talk at least once, you should consider finding a new advisor.)  


### 5) Prepare meticulously.

You are being judged -- or else you are being ignored, which is itself a harsh judgment.  You should be ready!    

Being prepared is more than just knowing what you're talking about (see above) or practicing the talk itself (see below).  Being prepared means thinking carefully about every link in the logical chain of your argument.  It means having that logical chain down cold in your mind, so that you can always return to it if distracted.  It means ensuring that your slides correspond precisely to that logical flow.  It means nailing the figures and tables.  It means, if necessary, writing out and memorizing key sections of your talk, especially those sections where you _really_ don't want to get distracted by some tangential point.  It means making and using notes, if you need them.  Above all, it means forcing yourself to think like a member of the audience and making choices accordingly.  

A personal note: the very first talk I ever gave at a scientific meeting was the 2008 conference of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA).  It was before my final year of grad school, a few months before I would be going on the job market.  I was nervous as hell, and I didn't want to screw it up.  So I wrote out everything I wanted to say, word for word, and memorized it.  I also had backup notes to put on the lectern near me, in case I lost my train of thought.  That might have been extreme, but at least nobody could accuse me of being unprepared!  

At the very least, I give the following advice to everyone preparing for their first scientific presentation.  Write out the first ~60 seconds of your talk word for word, and at least memorize that.  This will usually include the title slide ("Thanks for inviting me to be here today.  My name is so-and-so, and I'm talking today about this-and-that.  This is joint work with Jack and Jill...").  It will usually also include the first substantive slide of the talk.  If you memorize that far, you will at least be making sense for a full minute, as your adrenaline and nervousness are likely at their peak.  Once you get over the first-minute hump, your nervousness will ebb, and you'll feel a lot more comfortable even if you haven't memorized the remaining N-1 minutes of your talk.  


### 6) Stop relying so much on bulleted lists.     

Bulleted lists are usually pretty drab. In most talks, they're not for the audience.  Rather they are crutches for the speaker -- speakers who, had they prepared more meticulously, wouldn't need the crutch.  

It helps to think of your talk as a noisy two-channel communication link, and to view the problem as one of optimizing information transfer across those two noisy channels.  One channel is auditory: what you say.  This channel has a low maximum bandwidth, about 150 words per minute.  It is also statistically noisy (no pun intended): people can mishear you, misunderstand you, not quite get what you say the first time through, etc.  The other channel is visual: what you show on your slides.  It is much less noisy than the auditory channel.  It also has a much higher maximum bandwidth -- as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.  In fact, it can be so high in bandwidth that people usually need some help, in the form of your verbal narration, to understand what they're seeing in a complicated figure.  

To me, these facts have a few corollaries:  
  
1) To maximize bandwidth, you should spend as much time as you reasonably can showing pictures, describing those pictures, and summarizing the take-away lessons of those pictures verbally.  (In a mathy talk, a "picture" might be a key equation.)   
2) In any noisy communication channel, there is some optimal amount of redundancy.  Therefore it's a good idea to have a few key places where you summarize the main points as text on screen, in addition to stating them out loud.  The visual channel then provides redundancy for the noisy auditory channel.  This is a sensible use of bulleted lists.  
3) But the optimal amount of redundancy is absolutely _not_ 100%, or indeed anywhere close to it.  Said plainly, don't have a giant chunk of your talk devoted to slides full of bulleted lists, in which you read/paraphrase the bullets.  That's a giant waste of bandwidth.   People read faster than you can talk.  When you paraphrase bullets, people who are reading get to the end way faster than you can get there speaking.  Therefore you are spending a huge amount of time boring them.  

Of course there are exceptions.  But for every bulleted list you find yourself compelled to include, it's worth asking the same questions.  Can I ditch this?  Is this bulleted list genuinely there to ensure information redundancy of a key point across the noisy auditory channel?  Or is this just a crutch for me because I fear being insufficiently prepared?  Can I verbally convey the same information, while at the same time displaying something more visually dynamic -- ideally some picture that is "logically upstream" of your bullets, something further to the left in your left-to-right chain of syllogisms and inferences?  Often the answers are yes. 

Similarly, with rare exceptions, do not write full paragraphs on slides.  One exception obvious might be a quotation from someone you interviewed, or some other scientist expressing a claim that you intend to buttress/refute/riff off.  
 
Said another way, your slides should _complement_ what you say.  Occassionally they might _summarize_ what you say.  Only rarely, if at all, should they just _replicate_ what you say. After all, you have so much to convey and so little time.  Make the best use of both information channels at your disposal.  Build in a little redundancy, but not 100%, and stop relying so much on bulleted lists.  


### 7) Make your figures great.  

Since you will rely so heavily on your figures, that's where to invest a ton of time.  Even a simple scatter plot should be elegant and highly readable, with clear axis labels, a well thought-out color scheme, and so on.  This isn't a guide on how to make awesome figures, but you should learn to make awesome figures: [here](http://ggplot2.org/), perhaps, or [here.](https://d3js.org/)  


### 8) Smile.

Don't be manic, but do have energy and presence.  Stand up straight, engage your core, throw your shoulders back, and have positive body language.  You'll be surprised at how much better you come across.  

### 9) Practice.  

It's like what my very first Little League coach, who also happened to be my dad, said to me when I was 6 years old.  You play like you practice.  


### 10) Treat your talk as a gateway drug.

The primary functions of your talk are to excite people about you and your work, and to funnel the especially interested ones to your paper or software package.  

There _is_ a publically available paper or software package that people can go find, right?
