# Scientific talks: some biased, highly imperfect advice

My goal here is to provide a "plug and play" guide for scientific talks.  My advice is geared towards Ph.D students in data-science-related subjects, although some of it is more generally applicable.  I certainly don't claim my advice is comprehensive, optimal/perfect for every situation, or better than the advice you might have been given elsewhere, by someone who is better at giving talks than I am.  And it certainly reflects my own biases and experiences.  Still. if you don't know where to begin, you might consider beginning here.  

Two notes:  
1) This is a work in progress.  
2) The bias here is towards short talks (say, 10-25 minutes in length).  Some of the advice, however, also works for longer talks, of the kind you might give in a departmental seminar or a job interview.  

### General advice  

- [The first thing you should do](md/first_thing.md) before you start working on your talk.  
- [My top ten tips](md/top_ten.md) for giving scientific talks.  
- [Further miscellaneous tips](md/misc.md) that didn't quite make my top ten.  

### Organization  

Before you decide how to organize your talk, [read this](md/first_thing.md).  As I said above, the bias here is towards short talks.  

- [Organizing a talk about a new method.](md/org_methods.md)  
- [Organizing a talk about new empirical findings.](md/org_results.md)  
- Organizing a talk about new theory: sorry, I have no good advice here.  Ask a theorist!
