# Scientific talks: some biased, highly imperfect advice

The goal of this guide is to provide a "plug and play" guide for scientific talks.  It is geared towards Ph.D students in data-science-related subjects, although some of the advice is more generally applicable.  I don't claim my advice is optimal/perfect for every situation, or better than the advice you might have been given elsewhere.  And my advice reflects my own biases and experiences.  But if you don't know where to begin, you might consider beginning here.
